# Python programming tutorial

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_\(programming_language\)) is a high-level, interactive and object-oriented programming language. Its simple syntax makes it a great choice for a first programming language for a beginner.

No tutorial is good for everyone. This one is aimed at people with no programming experience at all. If you have programmed in the past with some other language you probably want to read [the offical tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead. Like most other tutorials, this tutorial starts with maths. You can skip that if you hate maths.

This tutorial uses Python 3. Python 2 is not under active developement anymore, and more and more projects are moving to Python 3. Currently there are a few packages that don't support Python 3 that well at the time of writing this (such as twisted), but if you haven't programmed yet Python 3 is a great choice.

In this tutorial (and in most other tutorials) it's completely fine to simply read nothing but the example code, then come back and read the explonation for it if you don't fully understand it. There's nothing wrong with not reading every word in the documentation when all you need is the example code.

When learning a programming language it's important to **experiment and not fear trying new things that you didn't read from a tutorial**. It's almost impossible to break your computer accidentally with Python. Typing something wrong will simply make an error message that tells you what's wrong, it will not destroy anything.

Here's a list of chapters in this tutorial:

1. [Installing Python and using it as a calculator](1.md)
2. [Strings and variables](2.md)
3. [Using functions and storing code in files](3.md)
