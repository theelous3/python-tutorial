# Answers

These are answers for exercises in the chapters. In programming, there's always more than one way to do things, so if your solution wasn't exactly like mine it's not necessarily wrong. Some pythonists say that there should be only one right way, but that goal will never be fully reached.

### Chapter 1

1. 18996.20 â‚¬

        >>> 49.95 + 200
        249.95
        >>> 100 * 249.95
        24995.0
        >>> 1 - (24 / 100)
        0.76
        >>> 24995.0 * 0.76
        18996.2
        >>>

    All in one line:

        >>> 100 * (49.95 + 200) * (1 - (24 / 100))
        18996.2
        >>>

2. About 523

        >>> (4 / 3) * 3.14 * (5 * 5 * 5)
        523.3333333333334
        >>> 4 / 3 * 3.14 * 5 * 5 * 5      # parenthesis aren't needed
        523.3333333333334
        >>>

    More advanced way:

        >>> from math import pi
        >>> 4 / 3 * pi * 5 ** 3
        523.5987755982989
        >>>

### Chapter 3

1. Like this:

        word = input("Enter a word: ")
        print(word * 1000)

2. Like this:

        word = input("Enter a word: ")
        word += " "
        print(word * 1000)

    You can also add the space right away on the first line:

        word = input("Enter a word: ") + " "
        print(word * 1000)

    Of course, there are 999 spaces between 1000 words and this will print 1000 spaces instead, so there will be a useless space at the end, but it doesn't matter. To get rid of the space, you can do something like this instead:

        no_space = input("Enter a word: ")
        yes_space = no_space + " "
        print(yes_space * 999 + no_space)

3. Like this:

        first = input("Enter a word: ")
        second = input("Enter another word: ")
        words = first + " " + second + " "
        print(words * 1000)
